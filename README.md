# Student Performance Prediction

## Project Objective

The objective of this project is to predict students' academic performance based on various factors influencing their educational outcomes. The analysis utilizes data on study hours, previous scores, extracurricular activities, sleep hours, and the number of sample question papers practiced. The purpose of this project is to analyze and predict the academic performance of students using multiple linear regression techniques. The dataset used for this project contains various attributes that potentially influence student performance, such as demographic information, grades in previous subjects, and other relevant factors.

## Used Variables

The following variables were utilized in the project:

- **Hours Studied**: The number of hours students dedicate to studying.
- **Previous Scores**: Students' scores from earlier exams or tests.
- **Extracurricular Activities**: Students' participation in extracurricular activities that may affect their study time.
- **Sleep Hours**: The average number of hours of sleep per day, which can influence concentration and academic performance.
- **Sample Question Papers Practiced**: The number of practice papers that students worked on before exams.
- **Performance Index**: An index representing the overall score of the student.

## Methodology

The project employs multiple linear regression analysis to predict the **Performance Index** based on the mentioned variables. The data was divided into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's accuracy.

## Requirements

To run the project, the following libraries are required:
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
